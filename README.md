# Scrap-Rid
HackVSIT 4.0 Hackathon Project 

ScrapRid is here
At ScrapRid, we focus on channelizing the scrap that enters and leaves India. In terms of creating jobs and boosting the GDP, we firmly believe that the scrap vending sector has a huge amount of potential.
Our goal is to give vulnerable scrap merchants a stable source of income and organise the movement of scrap around the country. We accept pickup requests from customers and dispatch our vendors to gather the scrap. By bridging the gap between collectors and consumers, we aim to elevate the concept of recycling and reusing.

ScrapRid is a service that enables you to sell your used items in a planned fashion as opposed to simply throwing them away.
Simply give us a call or send us a note, and bam! You simply get rid of your stuff!
